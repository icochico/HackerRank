 Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:
The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.
Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
For example:
  stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
  get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
  # returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.

  // To accomplish this, suppose that we keep track of the minimum value in the
  // first k elements, along with the maximum profit we could make in the first
  // k elements.  Upon seeing the (k + 1)st element, we update what the current
  // minimum value is, then update what the maximum profit we can make is by
  // seeing whether the difference between the (k + 1)st element and the new
  // minimum value is.  Note that it doesn't matter what order we do this in; if
  // the (k + 1)st element is the smallest element so far, there's no possible way
  // that we could increase our profit by selling at that point.

  // To finish up this algorithm, we should note that given just the first price,
  // the maximum possible profit is 0.

  // This gives the following simple and elegant algorithm for the maximum single-
  // sell profit problem:

  // Let profit = 0.
  // Let min = arr[0]
  // For k = 1 to length(arr):
  //    If arr[k] < min, set min = arr[k]
  // If profit < arr[k] - min, set profit = arr[k] - min

      // Update the maximum profit to be the larger of the old profit and the
      // profit made by buying at the lowest value and selling at the current
      // price.
